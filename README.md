# JA2 v1.13 Wildfire 6.07 (Map Mod)
</p>


> This is a map mod for use with JA2 v1.13, **_not_** the standalone game Wildfire  
  
  
   
### Preamble

In the past, WF 6.07 has been hosted and updated  on a SVN, but that service stopped in 2022.   
To preserve the mod, it has been transferred to gitHub in december 2022  
The SVN had files for WF 6.06 included. Since those were stated outdated in its readme and hadn't seen any update in years, they had been removed after transfer to gitHub.  

Necessary file changes to match up with JA2 v1.13 have previously been made via SVN.   
However, the last update to SVN happened at 08.10.2020 (in old naming convention, JA2 v1.13 r8899)  
Therefore, it may occur that changes made to JA2 v1.13 inbetween are not properly reflected.  
So far, no problems have been reported related to that, but, just in case, be aware of that.  
In case of any issues, look at [Reports](#Reports) or [Participation](#Participation)
